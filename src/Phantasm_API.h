// A view is published as a Magelight texture image when Magelight UI with GPU texture images (its D3D11 renderer) is
// installed. With no Magelight at all (or one too old for texture images, which counts as none), since 1.0.0, a view
// whose client set its `hostless` hint draws with no image: Shown carries the SRV alone (imageName and imageUrl empty)
// for the client's own D3D11 draw (another UI host, an overlay); any other view ends "no-image" there, as before. A
// Magelight that cannot take images (its CPU renderer, or before its first in-game frame) ends views "no-image". A
// Cutout, Portrait or item still draws on its own and needs no UI host (since 0.2.0; pluginVersion). Phantasm runs on
// Skyrim SE, AE and VR. Live views and stills work on Skyrim VR too, but VR has been tested less than SE and AE.
//
// What is frozen: every function, struct field, enum value and reason token below keeps its meaning forever.
// Interface1 grows only by appending, so RequestPluginAPI(kInterface1) keeps answering with it: a later build adds
// functions to the end of a table and fields to the end of a struct, and each carries its size. A function or field
// marked as added later is there only when `size >= offsetof(<struct>, <name>) + sizeof(<name>)`, so check before
// calling or reading it (a non-null Interface1 from an older build ends before them). An appended field starts at or
// past the older struct's sizeof, never in its tail padding, or that test would pass against it. What is NOT frozen:
// the hints and queries (SetHint / QueryHint: their keys, values and answers) and the renderer's look (pose, light,
// camera), which may change in any release; a client must keep working when a hint is ignored.
//
// Threads: every function but RebuildActor3D may be called from any thread, inside Magelight's Present included, and
// never blocks. A call that returns Ok has only been accepted: its work runs later on the game thread, view and hint
// changes in the order they were made, and its outcome arrives as an event. A call that returns anything else changes
// nothing and no event follows it. Events are delivered on the game thread, outside any render phase, so a handler may
// read RE:: state and call this API again (RebuildActor3D excepted, see it).
